## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I learned how to modify a design based on its mobile version vs its desktop version, with the help of position and flexbox.

Some code snippets:

```html
<main class="background"></main>
```

```css
.background {
  background-image: url(./images/bg-desktop.svg);
  background-position: center center;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 100px;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Fontawesome](https://www.fontawesome.com) - I used their social media icons to complete my design.
